                Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and
                other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal
                data.

                What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of
                knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our
                privacy and freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
                But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it's simple: An
                autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage
                powered by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation,
                and end-to-end encryption.
            </p>
            <p>
                Put even simpler — <b>it's the internet, completely decentralized.</b>
